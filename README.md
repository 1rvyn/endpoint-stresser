# Endpoint-stresser
A go program to send requests at a given amount per-second for a given amount of time.

Very useful to see which functions consume CPU/Memory at the register endpoint and for testing database inserts. 

# Real-world application
You will most likely get rate limited for hitting the same endpoint with the same IP so quickly.
